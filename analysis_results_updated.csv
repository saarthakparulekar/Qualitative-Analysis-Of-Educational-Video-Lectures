you have this additional interesting peculiarity character objects remember we saw ASCII symbols character objects are defined to hold such symbols One byte storage is allocated to every car time the declaration is using first underscore later underscore of underscore name basically all these variables independent of the name are capable of storing one value between 0 to 255 which is interpreted to be an ASCII code of decimal value fractional values character values are written,-22.59,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Positive,High
close the single quotation so single coat P single coat single coat star single coat what is the third one single quote blank space single core there are many symbols which are not visible to US after there are 256 skills some simple services A to Z 012345 6789 + new line character C plus plus provides a notation if we want to specify any one of these characters as a value we can put escape character Back slash so a post office closed means it is a tab character new line character,-4.99,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Neutral,Medium
you saw that on the screen when you edit a program there are lines the first line many times the next statement does not continue their it comes on the next line you typically press enter button to go to the next what is inserted internally is a new line character and that is shown by this suppose I want to put a single quote itself as a character how can I do that if I wrote code is my code and this is my closing code no because the first quote followed by the second court c plus plus character which actually has a value zero it is represented by Value and,-17.85,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Neutral,Medium
it will come to this third who is this if I want to prescribe an apostrophe then I will have to use a backless nearly means interpret the next character that I type as a special character how do I include a backslash itself means something special the next backless is actually special character in my program I can say same is equal to P in single person what will be stored inside the location for same will be the value of P do you remember,1.11,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Positive,Medium
last time we saw mno3 sorry 1125 left right we don't know what is the beauty C plus plus Street every character object numerical integer value because it is actually what is being stored in that one by is an unsigned integer 0 to 255 consequently C plus plus objects to participate in numerical computations can add something to eat multiplied by somebody of course multiply the value of P by 27 can be done so look at this,-0.26,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Positive,High
sim 1 sim 2 sim 1 is equal to mistake here I have to say this right symbol value for M has gone into symbol what will be the value of sim 2 he says are can you figure out why we don't know what is the symbolic value of number we know that symbolic values for all the valid symbols are given in increasing order so if you have some value next value will be in next value will be next value will be X value will become a + 1 and + 2 + 3 + 4,0.43,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Positive,Medium
so somebody was calculating it so fast that is kept one letter so what should be the value here will actually use this feature later when we learn to handle character value for the time being just treat it as a different data type the busy slide is not much time I still want to come to the expression evaluation quickly slightly longer lecture so ignore this like you can read it later assignment operation this is the most important computational operation understand equal to something that statement is said to be an assignment,-15.48,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Positive,High
statement has two sides across the equal to symbol the equal to symbol is not the representative of equality equal to symbol is called assignment operator it has a left hand side and a right hand side the left hand side must be a single name representing an object which will receive the assigned value the right hand side is usually expression which is calculated and that results in a single value assignment operation works is the value on the right hand side is evaluated in the sample case the value is - 3 3,-15.48,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Positive,Medium
the expression can contain multiple arithmetic operators what are the Arithmetic operators their familiar with minus plus star slash percent is a modulo operator it gives remainder so for example if I have something like 10 modulo 4 what will be the value to because 42810 - 8 is to the remainder is 2 common sense all of your familiar division multiplication happens before addition and subtraction modulation if in an expression there are operators one after another which are at the same principle if you don't like that president if you want something has to be done first then you include those operations in parenthesis,-43.57,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Positive,High
super scene the natural law of associativity and precedence the general form of expression is this name is equal to expression is understood RHS is evaluated here is a sample example given how will this expression be evaluated what is the President first to multiplication so first this will be evaluated will get the value of then you say + 3 this will be valid what is the value of a equal to 16 question answer I want,1.78,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Positive,Medium
actually put value 4 in a but I want to tell C plus plus compiler the same thing in a different way I want to say a star a is equal to 60 is equal to 4 see all of you have gone into a mode of treating this as an equation a square equal to 16 therefore a can be either + 4 - 4 all that is silly know the first thing that you must observe is that it is a completely meaningless invalid statement for C plus plus because the left hand side has to be a single name single name because the receiver of a final value this is what I want you to understand if you want to say,-26.98,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Moderate,Positive,Medium
assign value 42 you have to say a equal to you cannot assign a value to an expression that is why I said you have to remember this equal to is not an equality symbol equal to is an assignment operator and the form of that operation is lhs is to be assigned the value of RHS RHS can be an expression but lhs has to be a single object location it cannot be a constant value also you cannot say 5 is equal to a that is left by location which can receive assignment is a receiver single receiver at,-14.13,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Positive,Medium
no confusion here is another example of assignment operation how will this be evaluated first the right hand side will be evaluated so what will be the first it will of course first take all the values which are available 5 + M is 5 x 4 / 2 - 3 is the expression now it will calculate what is the first one left to right to 20 by 2 calculate the distance to 5 + 10 - 3 next 50 and next it will do this calculate,12.61,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Neutral,Medium
another expression will not go through the values but I would like you to ponder over what will be done first what are the high priority operators multiplication how many multiplications are there 12345 we have said that if there are multiple operators at the same precedence the operation will be from left to right as far as this is concerned this will be done first this will be followed by this what about this operation what about this operation and this will be the next but please note that these components are separated by plus minus question whether 3.14159 multiplied by all will be calculated first,25.63,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Positive,Medium
weather 2 X 3.14 159 will be calculated first you must understand the rule of C plus plus does not specify that among two distinct groups of operations which are separated by lower level precedence operators what should be the presence of doing things the compiler will carry out even these things first that is not we consider particularly operators such as first is a name which represents,45.43,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Neutral,High
finally this is what you must remember lhs must be an object to which a value can be assigned must underscore mask no choice operand types this is the one possible country if both opponents of the same type result values of the same time very fundamental Rule By confusing sometimes even my program I write 9.0 divided by 2.0 the result will be 4.5 if I write in my program 9 / 2 the result will not be 4.5 is an integer division division divided by 2.0,70.73,High Fluency,Clear (Easy to understand),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Neutral,Medium
floating point 1 is integer it will convert 9 to floating point treat this as a floating point operation and calculate the correct value 4.2 I could also write this as 9.0 / 2 or I could also write this as 9.0 / 2.0 if I have in my program float eggs in n and somewhere in my program I said X / n is perfect is there and will be converted to floating point and the result will be a proper meaning,76.56,High Fluency,Clear (Easy to understand),Intermediate,High Engagement,Slow,Positive,Medium
activities 4.9 so will it show me 5 or 4 next slide does that possible problems in the expression evaluation by two values participating in an operation can individually be within stipulated range the result may not be in that way in such a case in Iran is value will be reason actually is not,15.65,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Neutral,High
J is equal to 1.24 e30 what will come into J remember 1.24 e30 is actually an integer number but that number is 124000 is a 4 bit number it can atmosphere of the zeros complete loss of this should never be done our problem Y is equal to 29 is interested to 129 Y = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 integer is being converted to floating point the floating point representation actually is point 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 multiplied by even this is a floating point in my representation will be point 1 2 3 4 5 6,52.16,High Fluency,Moderate (Understandable),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Neutral,Medium
789 however the mantissa has more disease than what can be accommodated in a 32 bit number what the C plus plus compiler actually does is this time it is more generous it will round of the last so it can if it can store for example 6 digits of mental 3 4 5 7 here is an expression how do I write an expression yes can you help me multiplied by,15.32,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Intermediate,High Engagement,Slow,Positive,High
there is nothing like x cube x square x available as an operator try to multiply this expression suppose I had this one upon X + 1 + 1 upon Something Something it is possible that you start writing expression which is the bracket here in bracket in bracket bracket here towards the end of the machine does not have the largest element operation,17.01,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Neutral,High
itself is treated as an expression is another Google of C plus plus so when I say m is equal to N is equal to 25 is a valid statement in C plus plus what it means is m is equal to in bracket n is equal to 25 now this is a valid assignment statement when it is executed 25 value is assigned to an apart from assigning the value 25 to N C plus plus streets that this entire expression also as a value 25 the same 25 value can go into consequently if I have declared in MNP and if I want to initialise all of them to a value 10 then I cannot do that in the declaration,-26.98,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Moderate,Positive,Medium
object on lhs May appear in an expression on RHS this is one of the most important point when I say n is equal to 3 star M + 2 star and it is a valid statement assume that N has some value let us say and currently has a value 5 before I come to this expression at home what will happen has a value 3 is before C plus plus two it will replace the values here it will say I have to calculate 3 multiplied by 3 + 2 x 5 in this I have this to be done first 9 + 2 x 5 then I have to do this next which means 9 +,-11.42,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Positive,Medium
this is the value of the expression now it will look at the left hand side so please understand if a variable object appearing on the left hand side also appears on the right hand side there is no dilemma because C plus plus compiler to begin with does not look at all at the left hand side it doesn't care what location is specified look at the right hand side substitutes values calculate the final value now it looks at the left hand side left 195 this is often used increment operator for example I can say is equal to before the execution of this statement was 25 after this will become 26 this is used in many kind of Counting algorithms which will be used,-40.52,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Beginner,Low Engagement,Moderate,Positive,Medium
Sudarshan Minu confusion always remember we are not talking about a equation is a right hand side which has M + 1 it is calculated from value comes that becomes a new value of is it ok stop here I have several others lights OK I will just take this line road x y Avogadro's number 6.023 23 so now x is equal to Y - 8.65 97 + advocate how will it calculate it will calculate Y - 8.65 what value will get complicated,67.79,High Fluency,Moderate (Understandable),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Positive,High
yes minus any one person please if you are doing it mental is not a good idea -1.31 -1.314 to this I want to add a value which is 6230000 what will be the final value now if I strictly do the subtraction the value should be 602 299999 again till I get board and some values that,75.88,High Fluency,Clear (Easy to understand),Beginner,Low Engagement,Slow,Positive,High
which will be 66868 this is the correct value I call this in Accountants value but an engineer and scientist value is not this what will happen in C plus plus it will say you have so many so much of president I can't stop all of this I will store it in my 6 or 70 is the President number 14 point number I will convert it appropriately I will represent 602320 is equal to,19.72,High Fluency,Difficult (Complex language),Intermediate,High Engagement,Slow,Positive,Medium
