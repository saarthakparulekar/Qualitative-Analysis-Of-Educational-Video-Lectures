Python a high level interpreted programming language famous for its zen like code it's arguably the most popular language in the world because it's easy to learn practical for serious projects in fact you're watching this youtube video in a python web application right now he was created bike and released in 1991 the name that after modified plants.
Machine learning many students because of its emphasis on readability as outlined by design of python beautiful is better than ugly while exposit is better than implicit python is very simple but it was the temptation to sprinkle and magic that causes and security organisation.

It also has a huge ecosystem of third party libraries such as deep learning frameworks like tensorflow and wrappers for many high performance low level packages like open computer vision which are most often installed with that hip package manager this is when the python programming language in 100 seconds hit the like button if you want to see more short videos like this thanks for watching and i will see you in the next one.
